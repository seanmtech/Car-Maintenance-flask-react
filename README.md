# Car-Maintenance-flask-react

This is an in-progress full stack project I am building to help myself remember when maintenance is due on my family's cars.
My first objective in my MVP is to allow a user to add their car's current mileage, 
  have the app periodically calculate based on an average how far they've driven since that mileage was entered
  and then email or text the user a reminder that a certain service is due soon.

Later, I hope to find a 3rd party API to integrate with (or build out a database model myself) that can give model-specific maintenance reminders.
